# Upper Martial Arts Ontology
The Upper Martial Arts Ontology (UMAO)

# What is it?
A bit of a passion project began in the summer of 2021 as a means of getting familiar with the Protege ontology editing tool. It aligns with the Schema.org ontology.

# What is the scope of the graph?
It's intentionally high-level; I make no mention of any specific martial arts, only the elements common to all of these physical arts. 

# What is the intent of the graph?
For me, to learn Protege. Eventually for all, to enable the description of any and all specific martial arts in implemented knowledge graphs. Right now it's just a comprehensive schema (as comprehensive as I can get it to be).

# Where is the knowledge derived from?
I am not a mystic, therefore knowledge must be derived from thought. This ontology is derived from my own conceptualization of martial arts, in addition to my reading "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" by the great Bruce Lee.

# Is it done?
No, not really. I will never be satisfied with it. It may serve well as a basis for someone else who is more knowledgeable, but I will probably be editing it for a long time intermittently.

# Can I use it?
I don't care lol. Just link back to this Github for reference to future versions.
